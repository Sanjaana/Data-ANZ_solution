# Data-ANZ_solution
My approach to the problem set given as a part of virtual internship project  by ANZ (Forage)

DataSet: Comprises of transaction dataset of 100 unique customers with recurring transactions, including salary transactions. Duration of transaction data: 3 months.

Task1: EDA-> To check for data issues,imputing null values and discarding irrelevant columns in order to create a final cleaned dataset.According to the task, gathered  insights about the data related to Average transaction amount and number of transactions customers make on a daywise and monthwise basis.Explored relationship among various customer attributes as given on the dataset like: age, merchant states, card status,flag status,mode of transaction,gender etc .Predicted if the transaction is posted (transaction is cleared and charged in the credit card) or authorized(transaction is still pending). Logistic regression and decision tree algorithm was used for prediction purposes.

Task2: Derived the annual salary for each customer from the dataset and plotted relationship between annual salary and other customer attributes present in the dataset. For this case age,gender,merchant state,mode of transaction,movement(Credit or Debit) and status (authorized or posted) is plotted against annual salary and insights are gathered. Further, an attempt to predict annual salary was done via Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithm.
